    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> 
        I am a highly motivated and results-driven biochemical automation research scientist
        with 8+ years of comprehensive cross-industry experience in biotechnology and finance sectors, 
        currently transitioning into software engineering. Through dedicated self-directed learning, 
        formal coursework, and collaboration with industry experts, I have established foundational 
        proficiency in Python, SQL, and scripting technologies, successfully applying these skills to 
        automate laboratory workflows and develop data-driven solutions for process optimisation and
        analytical applications. My career has honed my problem-solving abilities, analytical mindset,
        and adaptability that seamlessly translate into building efficient, scalable, and innovative 
        software solutions. Eager to join a dynamic team, I bring a unique combination of scientific 
        rigor, growing technical skills, and a passion for tackling complex challenges in modern 
        software development.
